[LIVE DEMO](http://qualitydixon.github.io/CrossfitClock/)

## Built with...

- React
- React-Router
- Webpack
- Less
- ESLint (StandardJS).

## Installation

Clone this repo, run `npm install`, then `npm run start`. You will see the project at `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.

## Todo

- ~~Update timer when user changes session length. Currently need to hit reset button to change set time.~~
- ~~Highlight which mode is selected in menu.~~
- ~~Update screenshots.~~
- ~~Add live demo.~~
- Maybe get rid or React Router. Doesn't help but might not hurt anything either.
- Tabata mode shows one extra work countdown at end of session.

## Codepen

This project started as a codepen and was moved to github when it became unwieldy to have all the code in one file. The codepen version is functional, though no longer maintained. See it [here](http://codepen.io/qualitydixon/pen/wMNqXq).
