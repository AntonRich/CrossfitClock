LIVE DEMO

## Installation

Just fork and clone this repo, run `npm install`, then `npm run start`. You will see the project at `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.

## Todo

- Update timer when user changes session length. Currently need to hit reset button to change time.
- UI does not work well on thin screens.
- Highlight which mode is selected in menu.
- Update screenshots.
- Add live demo.

## Codepen

This project started as a codepen and was moved to codepen when it became unwieldy to have all the code in one file. It is functional, though no longer maintained. See it [here](http://codepen.io/qualitydixon/pen/wMNqXq)
