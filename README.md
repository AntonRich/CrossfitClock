- UI does not work well on thin screens.
- Highlight which mode is selected in menu.
- Update screenshots.
- Add live demo.

## Codepen

This project started as a codepen and was moved to github when it became unwieldy to have all the code in one file. The codepen version is functional, though no longer maintained. See it [here](http://codepen.io/qualitydixon/pen/wMNqXq)
